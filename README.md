# hello
this is a fun project for me to play around building things
this could include code, backends, swift, etc
who knows, maybe things like Rive, d3.js, lottie, or Spline
anything that creates dynamic and interesting experiences
the goal is to become an artist with software
to go deeper into te medium of user interfaces
creating software people truly love
playful interactions
sound
responsiveness
breadth
direct manipulation of data
